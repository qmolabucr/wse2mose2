DESCRIPTION:

This code is published alongside the paper 'Stacking enabled vibronic exciton-phonon states in van der
Waals heterojunctions' and contains the data and visualization code for all main text figures
and supplementary figures containing data or calculations not included in the main text figures.

The aim of this code is to release the data described in this paper and document the analysis and visualization steps
needed to get the results shown. Data contained herein is calibrated and has undergone some basic processing (such as
drift correction of imaging data described in Supplementary Materials).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

This code runs on python (version 3) and requires the following python packages:

numpy version 1.13+
scipy version 1.1+
matplotlib 2.0+

All of these can be installed using python's pip package manager.

COMMAND LINE INTERFACE INSTRUCTIONS:

The visualization scripts were written with a simple command line interface, see full options can be seen using:
> python fig1.py -h
The main function being to save the images generated by the visualization scripts using the "-s" argument
> python fig1.py -s
Which will save the output will be saved to a local 'figs' directory. To save to a specific directory use the "-sf" argument
> python fig1.py -s -sf PATH\TO\SAVE\DIRECTORY
